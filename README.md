# Felting Needle Holder

<!---  SUMMARY  --->
The Felting Needle Holder is an open assistive technology device intended to make it easier to hold and manipulate a felting needle. The holder is ball-shaped with a diameter of 50Â mm, and is comprised of four 3D printed parts. This aid is designed to be used with a felting needle that has a metal shaft with a bent end (e.g., [DIMENSIONS Replacement Felting Needles 72-73664](https://www.amazon.ca/Dimensions-Needlecrafts-Feltworks-Replacement-Felting/dp/B004W8TGIS)).

The holder consists of several 3D printed parts. No additional hardware is required. The overall cost of materials is about $1.

The Felting Needle Holder is an open assistive technology (OpenAT). Under the terms of the open source licenses, the device may be built, used, and improved upon by anyone.

Last Updated: 2024-May-16
The latest version (1.0) now includes a cover for the needle and labels to help indicate the direction to spin the ball to open or close it. The previous version (0.2) was built and tested by at least one user.
